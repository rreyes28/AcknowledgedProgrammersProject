# AcknowledgedProgrammersProject

The Acknowledged Programmers Project (APP) was a project done from 2016-2019 that was inspired by the movie Hidden Figures. The purpose of our research was to identify any programmers - particularly women - that were acknowledged in the acknowledgements section of a paper rather than given authorship. We looked into the years of 1970-1990. Below is the abstract and citation for the paper that was later published in the Perspectives section of the Genetics journal in February 2019. 

*Abstract:*
While productivity in academia is measured through authorship, not all scientific contributors have been recognized as authors. We consider nonauthor “acknowledged programmers” (APs), who developed, ran, and sometimes analyzed the results of computer programs. We identified APs in Theoretical Population Biology articles published between 1970 and 1990, finding that APs were disproportionately women (P = 4.0 × 10−10). We note recurrent APs who contributed to several highly-cited manuscripts. The occurrence of APs decreased over time, corresponding to the masculinization of computer programming and the shift of programming responsibilities to individuals credited as authors. We conclude that, while previously overlooked, historically, women have made substantial contributions to computational biology.
